# Aeternus: The Symbiotic Workspace

**Aeternus** is a local-first, AI-native workspace designed for the long term. It blends the longevity of plain text with the capabilities of modern artificial intelligence. It is not just a place to store thoughts, but a place to think *with* a machine partner.

## 🏛 The Philosophy: Built to Last
Unlike cloud-only apps that lock your data away, Aeternus is built on three timeless pillars:

1. **Local & Sovereign**: Your data lives on your device in plain text (Markdown). If Aeternus disappears tomorrow, your ideas remain readable in any text editor.
2. **Symbiotic Intelligence**: AI is not a gimmick here; it is a second brain. It lives in the sidebar, reads what you write in real-time, and helps you connect, summarize, and critique your work.
3. **Minimalist Focus**: The interface recedes so you can enter the flow state.

## ⚡ Current Features
* **Neural Link**: Context-aware AI (Gemini or Local LLMs) that understands your active note.
* **Knowledge Graph**: Visualize the connections between your ideas.
* **Wiki-Links**: Connect thoughts naturally using `[[Double Brackets]]`.
* **Split View**: Work on two notes simultaneously.
* **Zen Mode**: Distraction-free writing environment.
